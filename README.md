## Description
This app is used to write out a note, save a note and delete a note 

## Motivation for Development
I want to be able to put notes somewhere electronically where I can easily access them. I wanted it to be simple and easy to use as I take several electronic notes throughout the day I knew this was a must. I also wanted to be able to delete or edit a note with ease. 

## User Story
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Technologies Used: 
This application uses require, express, HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Challenges 
One challenge is that I was unable to access the /notes from my routes. This was fixed by making it /notes/


## Successes
Successes included knowing for the most part what I needed but not putting everything in the right location. TA Zach helped me organize my thoughts and my code. 


## Directions for Future Development
For future development the ability to color coordinate notes by topic or even have note files would be helpful
